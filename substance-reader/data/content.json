Users should be able to focus on their writing, leaving the layout part to the authoring system entirely. The content produced should be exposed as data, which allows digital documents to be queried like a database, and eases integration of that content. With the help of Samo Korosec our designer in chief, we got a first release ready in February 2011. The initial feedback was great. More than 5000 people signed up within the first three months. At that time Substance was an experiment and not ready for production use. Since then we've been working hard to change that."

We have helped innovate publishers, such as eLife to improve the way scientific research is consumed online. Together with Ivan Grubisic from Berkeley we developed a new interactive display for scientific articles, eLife Lens. Only days ago, PubChase has made available the whole corpus of PubMed open access articles for viewing in Lens. Our work on Lens has also substantially driven the Substance project, as it served as a great real-world usecase. Credits go to Ian Mulvany from eLife for investing into that idea in the scope of an open source project. We are interested to see what other use cases people will develop. Don't hesitate to contact us if you want to bring in your idea."

We are still on our mission to build open software to help modernize digital publishing and move beyond simulating paper, as this is what current word-processors (MS Word, Apple Pages, OpenOffice) and formats (PDF) do. By promoting an open document format and supporting tools we want to unleash the full power of digital content and provide an interactive experience for authoring and viewing. Moreover, we would like to enable people to act as their own publisher and no longer be subject to the politics of big publishing companies and software vendors. In this post we would like to explain some decisions we have made in order to make that happen and what you can expect for the near future.
